  description: "A rather profitable place to live-- if you're a demon living in **the Canto of the 29th**. Tortured souls here, after falsifying metals in malice, are forced to excavate, extract, and refine the precious metals of Metallaes, without a minute's rest and with whips lashing against their backs and hands.\n\nMetallaes is known for a branch of the Malebolge running through it, the river of guilt composed by the closest known equivalent of mercury - if only a *tad* bit too much heavier - where souls that refuse to work in these inhumane conditions are forced to bathe in and end up drowning."
