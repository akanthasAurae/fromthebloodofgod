  location: "-28,0"
  description: "A rather profitable place to live-- if you're a demon living in **the Canto of the 29th**. Tortured souls here, after falsifying metals in malice, are forced to excavate, extract, and refine the precious metals of Metallaes, without a minute's rest and with whips lashing against their backs and hands.\n\nMetallaes is known for a branch of the Malebolge running through it, the river of guilt composed by the closest known equivalent of mercury - if only a *tad* bit too much heavier - where souls that refuse to work in these inhumane conditions are forced to bathe in and end up drowning.\n\nIt should be noted all forms of alchemy, done in malice, will land someone here. Science does not equal alchemy - to pursue alchemy is to pursue anything beyond science, such as attempting to research **[EXPUNGED]** and **[REDACTED]**."
