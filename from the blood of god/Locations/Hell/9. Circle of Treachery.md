  description: "The deepest, coldest layer of Hell, as close to the earth's core as one can get yet ever so freezing. House to the Royals and descendants of Lucifer, and at its frozen heart for a core, he is there frozen from the waist down, guarded by Cerberus.\n\nIt it worth noting these tortured souls demand special attention as each torture is singular, individual, and abbhoringly personal to the reason they're there; thus the need for a specialized elite to ensure they remain in line.\n\nIt possesses the **Cantos of the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th,** and separates from the Fraudulent (8th) layer by grace of **The Frozen River of Lamentation, Cocytus,** alongside the guard and protection of the **Tower of Illusion, Anteus, Canto of the 31st.**"
