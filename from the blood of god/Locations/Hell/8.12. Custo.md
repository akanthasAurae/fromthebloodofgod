  description: "Named Custo by the demons locally, it's a rather dark, cold and cave-like place in appearance and feel, housing a large tower, named Anteus, possessing the descent unto the 9th Layer of Hell.  It is **the Canto of the 31st.** It's guarded by what can only be described as wrath incarnated itself unto a kind of demon not even the Royals dare speak of.\n\nRumours say they are controlled by Lucifer himself, and they seem to completely ignore anyone who's meant to go into the layer below."
