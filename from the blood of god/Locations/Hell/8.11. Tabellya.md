  description: "A rather royal, fanciful place given the Layer and Sin - **the Canto of the 30th** consists of a large, arching rooftop, gorgeous architecture, and the torture of numbness.\n\nConsidered the closest you can get to an administrative chamber, Tabellya's torture consists of turning those whom falsified documents of persons, falsified coins or words to higher authorities, into slaves to sort and document their paperwork.\n\n... or so most of them think. The actual paperwork is handled within the 9th Layer, past Cocytus, by **the Canto of the 33rd.** All the work here is for nought, of course, given the source of it."
