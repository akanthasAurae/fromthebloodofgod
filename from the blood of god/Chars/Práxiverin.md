  description: "Youngest daughter of the descendants of Lucifer; wasn't meant to take the throne, but after the heir princess usurped Hell months before a centuries long war, she had to step up. A gorgoeus, well-tanned woman, with long, slightly curled auburn hair, with eyes like fire and sclera like the darkness."
  occupation: "Lordess of the Circle of Treachery in Hell."
  arc: 1
  ghost: "Being forced to take up the throne on her shoulders at barely the cusp of adulthood, all while still processing the likely loss of her love interest, whom had been sent off to war. The resentment from this only grew as she received him home only to find him nearly none unlike the man she'd fallen in mad love with."
  lie: "She believes gods have long outgrown their usefulness in this world, and actively - although in silence - seeks a way to rid the world of them."
  need: "Peace and quiet."
  want: "She believes she wants more violence - that perhaps the destruction of the gods will bring her the peace she needs."
  opposition: "Herself. To be specific, her power at its current growth is being outpaced by Merihem, but just the fact she believes to be incapable of growing to the power a god possesses."
  strengths: 688646
  weaknesses: 208917
  beliefs: "Violence will occur no matter what, with or without prompting. Only a greater form of violence can silence the lesser."
  behaviour: "Very regal, refined, and sophisticated. Does everything with class and poise."
