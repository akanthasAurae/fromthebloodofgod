  description: "Once originally an archangel, God's right hand; no longer, in the early rise of his adulthood he was swept alongside the centuries-long war, becoming a jaded war veteran, cast from heaven and resentful towards God. Long, azure locks adorn his visage, along with black sclera and crimson irises."
