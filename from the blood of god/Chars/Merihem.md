  description: "Once originally an archangel, God's right hand; no longer, in the early rise of his adulthood he was swept alongside the centuries-long war, becoming a jaded war veteran, cast from heaven and resentful towards God. Long, azure locks adorn his visage, along with black sclera and crimson irises."
  occupation: "Cardinal of the Circle of Treachery in Hell."
  arc: 2
  ghost: "His descent from Heaven-- both the agony it caused and the circumstances surrounding it-- plague him so. This is worsened significantly by the burden of trauma he experienced in captivity and in the battlefield during the war."
  lie: "He believes in the lie that God cast him out of the Heavens from malice, cruelty; that his fall was born from a place of hatred He had for him."
  need: "Answers."
  want: "Above all, he wishes to protect those he holds dear, and is willing to sacrifice anything to meet this end. Be it his dignity or what little vanity he holds in the accolades bestowed upon him from his deeds in the war."
  opposition: "His mind. His resentment for the one who he believes forsook him has impeded his quest for this power without him even realizing it."
  strengths: 164489
  weaknesses: 136209
  beliefs: "His strongest belief is that we live in a world where it's kill or be killed; taken to a literal, overwhelming level, leading him toward a constant chase for growth and power."
  behaviour: "Brash and arrogant, running headfirst into situations at times without much thought whatsoever. Ironically, he finds himself at the helm of mediating situations later on."
