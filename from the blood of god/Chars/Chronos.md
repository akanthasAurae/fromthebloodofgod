  description: "A reprehensible, now fallen angel, being tortured by Cerberus and being mauled in the Canto of the 34th. Born of snow white skin much like Lucifer, but having maintained his pearly-white locks, his sclera have turned obsidian from his fall, the reason for his fall being his betrayal towards his own Lord and guide, Vyzeny."
  occupation: "Being mauled in the Canto of the 34th."
  arc: 4
  need: "Recognition from Vyzeny."
  want: "Firstly, freedom. Secondly, power. He believes he needs - not wants - to be God, even if it means slaying Vyzeny to obtain this power."
  opposition: "His current predicament in the Canto of the 34th, being constantly mauled by Cerberus and mocked by Lucifer."
  strengths: 1638406
  weaknesses: 2391313
  beliefs: "He often attempts to gain Pr√°xi's sympathy and pity by agreeing on her stance that gods should be erased, yet falls silent when she sharply reminds him he once yearned to be one."
  behaviour: "Not like he can do much now - but back then, he was extremely intolerant of anything that strayed from the realm of science, math, and totally-not-alchemy, to the point of neglecting even those that sought to care for him."
